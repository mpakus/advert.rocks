        up with acclaimed video artist Marco Brambilla to create this short film that
        was acquired by Vera Wang and is currently installed in her flagship Beverly
        Hills store. The installation is an impressive 8 panel wall mounted version
        that plays as an offset reel of film.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe film was originally
        shot on Red Camera then effected in Autodesk Flame. We created transitions
        stitching multiple takes into one seamless clip and digitally hand painted
        degradation techniques to the footage. Out of the Flame the footage was scanned
        to 35mm motion picture film, where it was further degraded in multiple passes
        using bleach and other photo chemical processes. Those results were then loaded
        back into the flame where we used elements of the multiple degraded film prints
        to create more specific degradation. The silhouettes and other visual cues
        were also something handled in Flame.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDirector: Marco Brambilla<br
